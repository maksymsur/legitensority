# Is it possible to quantify an abstract construct like **Legitimacy**?

Can a method be developed in order to merge the concept of legitimacy with Data Science and Machine Learning tools?

How can it be used in order to aid:
* political and business leaders to prevent detachment from society and adhere their performance to existing societal values and trends,
* governments and international organizations to develop and implement principles, values and decision making criteria in order to unite, shape and lead a society + obtain an ability to explain all sorts of social behavior that would otherwise seem not connected or irrational,
* financial and business institutions to minimize potential sociopolitical risks, losses and predict the occurrence of certain events (preconditions) leading to opportunities.

PUBLICATION: We tried to answer these questions and show how the developed concept can be applied in practice (Ukraine was used as an example) in the recently published [book chapter](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/ukrainian-legitimacy-equation/250142).

PUBLIC PRESENTATION: The methodology was [presented at a seminar](https://ies.lublin.pl/pub/artykuly/2020-02/Plakat%20A3_Ukraine%20on%20Europe%27s%20Frontier_mail%20pdf.pdf) in the [Institute of Central Europe (Poland)](https://ies.lublin.pl/en). We considered new approaches to analysis & prediction of socio-political risks as well as necessity to foster implementation of legitimacy-based agile governance models.

The further work is being performed within a Legitensority research project.
